## Simplify String Mapping
In this question, we're given a mapping array: `similarPairs = [["great","fine"],["drama","acting"],["skills","talent"]]`. Rather than using it directly as a map, it's more efficient to convert each key-value pair into a string and add it to a `set`. We can then check the `set` to determine their mapping relationship.
